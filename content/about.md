Hi, I'm Danny Hawkins. I live in Dubai, United Arab Emirates but am originally from the United Kingdom.

I've been working in technology for over 20 years, I am an engineer who gets a thrill from augmenting human capability with technology. Especially in order to solve problems that would otherwise take a very long time, or be impossible.

I co-founded [Quiqup Delivery](https://quiqup.com) in 2014.
